## ðŸŒŸ Activation Functions in Deep Learning (Comprehensive Guide)

Activation functions are the heart of deep learning neural networks. Without them, our neural networks would just be a stack of linear functions, making them incapable of learning complex patterns. This guide explores activation functions in depthâ€”explaining their types, how they work, their mathematical properties, and when to use them.

## 1. What is an Activation Function?

An **activation function** is a mathematical equation that determines the output of a neural network node. It maps the input to an output based on a threshold or transformation. Without an activation function, a neural network acts like a simple linear regression model.

## 2. Why Do We Need Activation Functions?

* To introduce **non-linearity** into the model
* To help the network learn **complex functions**
