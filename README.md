## ðŸŒŸ Activation Functions in Deep Learning (Comprehensive Guide)

Activation functions are the heart of deep learning neural networks. Without them, our neural networks would just be a stack of linear functions, making them incapable of learning complex patterns. This guide explores activation functions in depthâ€”explaining their types, how they work, their mathematical properties, and when to use them.
